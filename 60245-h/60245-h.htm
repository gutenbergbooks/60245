<p>As men of the Sioux Expedition marched out of Fort
Laramie in the cold March weather of 1874 they probably
had more than a few misgivings about the outcome
of their adventure. They were headed for one of the
hottest spots on the Plains&mdash;Red Cloud Indian Agency.
General Sheridan hoped that the 949 man expedition was
large enough to intimidate the Indians and permit a peaceful
occupation of the agency, but it was his belief that
&ldquo;were it any other than this inclement season ... hostilities
would have commenced at the crossing of the North Platte
River.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Even with the large force and bad weather, open
war with the hostile Sioux Indians was a distinct possibility
and officers warned their men that straggling in camp or
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
on the march might well be fatal. They kept all Indians
away from their camps and marching column and warned
their men not to fire at either game or Indians, unless in
an unmistakable attack, lest injudicious gunfire needlessly
start a battle.</p>
<h3 id="c1">RED CLOUD AGENCY</h3>
<p>The treaty of 1868 had guaranteed the Sioux and other
tribes food and supplies in exchange for lands ceded to the
United States. The annuity goods granted the Oglala Sioux
by this treaty were issued at the Red Cloud Agency which
was located on the Platte River until 1873.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In June 1873 approximately 13,000 Indians were present
at Red Cloud Agency to receive issue goods. There
were 1,858 lodges, mostly of the Oglala, Wajaja and other
Sioux bands regularly supplied at Red Cloud, but including
168 lodges of Cheyenne, 237 lodges of Arapaho, and another
262 lodges of Miniconjou and other northern Sioux.</p>
<p>Among the Indians living at the agency a small faction
was friendly to white men while the majority, depending
upon the circumstances, wavered between friendliness and
hostility. There was also an openly hostile faction consisting
primarily of the northern Sioux, but Oglala warriors,
including the already famed Crazy Horse, were among the
hostile war parties pursued by cavalry patrols from nearby
Fort Laramie.</p>
<p>The Platte River location of Red Cloud Agency was in
the unceded hunting territory defined by the treaty of 1868.
Although the government desired to relocate the agency on
the permanent Dakota reservation, the Oglala stubbornly
refused to leave the Platte Valley.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1873, while the more recalcitrant
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
Indians were off on a buffalo hunt,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Indian Agent
Daniels induced those remaining at the agency to agree to
move northward to a new site on the White River. Such
leaders as Sitting Bull of the South<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> were incensed at losing
the line of the Platte River but were unable to prevent
it. The accomplishment earned Daniels a promotion by the
Episcopal Church, which nominated agents under the Peace
Policy, and Dr. J. J. Saville was appointed as the new
agent.</p>
<p>Dr. Saville arrived to assume his duties while the move
was in progress. During the summer and fall Saville was
busy organizing his agency and staff. He removed Jules
Ecoffey as agency trader, giving the appointment to his
friend J. W. Dear. Construction contracts for buildings at
the new site were given to A. R. Appleton, Saville&rsquo;s brother-in-law.</p>
<p>The summer and fall were relatively quiet at the
agency, but winter brought increasing problems for Saville.
He was troubled particularly by the hostile, northern Sioux
who came to the agency for the winter. They objected to
his efforts to obtain an actual count of Indians present so
that issue supplies could be ordered.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when Saville rode out on a counting
attempt, a group of northern warriors led by Little Big Man
and Pretty Bear surrounded him. They forcibly returned
him to his office, and there held an impromptu court-martial
which might have cost Saville his life had not Red Cloud
intervened. Undaunted by this experience, Saville gave a
feast for the Indian leaders at the agency on Christmas
Day in another effort to gain assent to the counting. At
this meeting he found that not only the northern Indians,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
but the chiefs he thought of as his supporters all opposed
the counting. Saville&rsquo;s other troubles included the jealousies
of various chiefs and the overbearing attitude of the
younger warriors who raised trouble during the issue of
beef, annoyed agency workmen, and demanded payment
for wood cut for use at the agency.</p>
<p>On another occasion a group of about three hundred
warriors from Red Cloud Agency threatened a group of
cowboys returning to the Platte River country to pick up
a herd of cattle to be delivered to the agencies. James H.
Cook, one of the cowboy group, turned the potentially violent
meeting into a friendly encounter by convincing the
war leader that an attack on the cattlemen would have
serious results. Such incidents, although causing no direct
harm, created tensions around the agency.</p>
<p>Saville&rsquo;s problems were increased by government misunderstanding
of the complexities of social organization
among the Indians at Red Cloud Agency. Red Cloud, for
whom the agency was named, was recognized by the government
as its chief, but after the Christmas feast Saville
reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that Old
Man Afraid of His Horses was both the leader of the sincerely
peaceful faction and the legitimate head chief recognized
by the Oglala. In more than one desperate crisis at
the agency Red Cloud either refused to assist the agent
or was powerless to act. At such times Saville looked for
aid from Old Man Afraid of His Horses, his son Young
Man Afraid of His Horses,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> Sitting Bull of the South, and
other friendly Indians. The failure to make more effective
use of the political power and social control of the Indian
leaders was an important factor in prolonging difficulties
at the agency.</p>
<p>Military authorities, aware of the troubles at the
agency, discussed stationing troops there as early as mid-January,
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
1874. General Sheridan opposed the move since
he believed such an effort would result in open war. He
was also unwilling to dispatch troops until April or May
because of the severity of winter weather. Moreover, neither
the agent nor the Indian Bureau had yet requested
military assistance.</p>
<p>Events in early February made military assistance necessary.
A large hostile war party in full regalia rode
through the unfinished stockade at Red Cloud Agency,
shot out the windows, and left on a raiding expedition. On
February 6 teamster Edward Gray, headed for the agency
with freight, was killed by Indians on the Running Water
(Niobrara River). Three days later, on February 9, while
Saville was at nearby Spotted Tail Agency for a conference
with Agent Howard regarding the tense situation, Frank
Appleton, acting agent at Red Cloud, was shot and killed
by a hostile Miniconjou warrior who had entered the agency.
On the same night fourteen mules were stolen from a government
contractor near the agency. The troubles were
not confined to Red Cloud. The Indians at Spotted Tail
Agency drove off the beef herders there and did their own
issuing. An attempt to shoot Agent Howard was prevented
by Black Crow.</p>
<p>Saville reported Frank Appleton&rsquo;s death and the departure
of the large war party to Colonel Smith at Fort
Laramie, saying at the same time &ldquo;I do not anticipate any
more trouble.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> His employees did not share his optimism
as shown by the agency physician, Dr. Grove, who took
Appleton&rsquo;s body to Fort Laramie and declared his lack of
desire to return to Red Cloud to be &ldquo;made a target of.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>On February 9, the same day Frank Appleton was shot,
the Army at Fort Laramie experienced losses at the hands
of hostiles from Red Cloud Agency when a large war party
ambushed Lt. Levi H. Robinson, Corporal Coleman, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
Private Noll. The three men had separated themselves from
a wood train and were attacked on Little Cottonwood Creek
some twelve miles east of Laramie Peak. Lieutenant Robinson
and Corporal Coleman were killed, but Private Noll
managed to escape from the forty to fifty hostile warriors.</p>
<p>J. W. Dear, the agency trader, reported the situation
at the agency to Colonel Smith, commander at Fort Laramie,
and to Mr. Unthank, a personal friend and the telegrapher
at Fort Laramie. Dear said that the Indians were
all going about with guns loaded and bows strung, and even
he dared not go outdoors at night. The hostiles had established
a war camp called Soldiers Lodge up on the Powder
River, and Sioux warriors were reported raiding in every
direction. It was clear that Red Cloud Agency had become
a virtual powder keg.</p>
<p>While Saville told Colonel Smith that he did not expect
any more trouble, he had taken steps to protect the
agency. He had his men complete the construction of the
stockade and move the steam sawmill inside to prevent its
destruction. He also arranged for sufficient arms for his
men to protect the agency, and a group of Indian policemen
led by Pumpkin Seed was organized to help.</p>
<h3 id="c2">THE SIOUX EXPEDITION</h3>
<p>Very shortly after Frank Appleton&rsquo;s death, Agent Saville
requested that troops be sent to Red Cloud Agency,
but his communications, sent to Colonel Smith at Fort Laramie,
were contradictory ones. He told Colonel Smith that
Crazy Horse had declared for war. Saville also told the
Colonel that although some of the hostiles were leaving
and all was quiet at the agency he wanted to have troops
to protect the agency and its personnel because affairs
among the Sioux were too complex to trust the Indians for
protection. He suggested that because of the departure of
the hostiles it was a good time to get troops to the agency
without trouble but cautioned the Colonel to send a force
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
sufficient to deal with an estimated 2,000 warriors. The
agent detailed a plan of march by which he thought the
military column could avoid detection by the Indians. However,
he admitted that Indian scouts were stationed all
along the Platte.</p>
<p>A request for troops to be stationed at the agency was
an admission of the failure of the Peace Policy. Saville&rsquo;s
reluctance to ask for help was apparently overcome by his
alarm over the serious troubles at the agency. His action
was later investigated and approved by Bishop Hare.</p>
<p>The Sioux Expedition was organized by the Army in
response to Saville&rsquo;s request for troops. The arrival of the
troops at the agency was delayed by the intense cold, but
the tension there had eased enough that officers, as well
as Saville himself, felt that they could hold out until the
soldiers arrived.</p>
<p>Cold weather was not the Army&rsquo;s only problem; the
call for extra supplies and ammunition had caught them
unprepared. Two hundred rounds of ammunition per man
were specified in the orders. To get this amount, Fort
Leavenworth was drained of supplies, and requisitions had
to be forwarded to Frankfort Arsenal. The lack of ammunition
set off some bitter correspondence between responsible
officers. The Chief of Ordnance reported to the Adjutant
General &ldquo;... that the want of ammunition in the
present seeming emergency can not be attributed to the
failure of this bureau to provide, but rather to the neglect
of the users to make the proper requisition at the proper
time.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Sioux Expedition got under way when eight infantry
and four cavalry companies marched from Fort D. A.
Russell, Wyoming Territory, to Fort Laramie. The troops
reached Fort Laramie on February 26 and 27, 1874 after
suffering severely from frost bite in the 38&deg; below zero cold.
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
At Fort Laramie four more companies of cavalry were added
to the expedition. At Fort D. A. Russell the Sioux Expedition
had been divided into two battalions, one cavalry and
one infantry.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The 547 cavalrymen, led by Major Baker, left Fort
Laramie on March 2, 1874 and reached Red Cloud Agency
on the fifth. Captain Lazelle and his battalion of 402 infantrymen
left Fort Laramie on March 3, arriving at the
agency on the seventh. Each battalion had a Gatling gun,
and the column was provisioned by a supply train of fifty
civilian and seventy government wagons. The supply train
carried ten days&rsquo; rations and five days&rsquo; forage and included
a beef herd.</p>
<p>Generals Sheridan and Ord were on hand for the departure
of the Sioux Expedition from Fort Laramie. The
officers considered keeping the expedition route a secret,
but it was apparent that the Indians were certain to discover
such a large force. The troops took the obvious route,
following the well known Fort Laramie to Fort Pierre fur
trade trail. On reaching the headwaters of the White River
the expedition was forced to ford the stream thirteen
times.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> As the expedition neared the agency the troops
passed abandoned Indian camps and when they reached
Red Cloud they found the northern troublemakers had all
departed for a new camp on nearby Hat Creek.</p>
<p>When the troops arrived at the agency Saville was undecided
about the establishment of the military camp. His
first suggestion was that a single camp be established at a
point equidistant from the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail
Agencies. By the next day he had changed his mind and
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
wanted the soldiers at Red Cloud, so the tent camp was
established alongside the blockhouse of the agency.</p>
<p>Four companies of infantry and one of cavalry were
left at Camp Red Cloud Agency, and the remainder of the
Sioux Expedition marched on to Spotted Tail Agency to
establish a camp there. The camp at Spotted Tail was named
Camp Sheridan and on March 29, 1874, the name of Camp
Red Cloud Agency was changed to Camp Robinson in honor
of Lt. Levi H. Robinson, who had been killed at Little Cottonwood
Creek the previous month.</p>
<p>Owing to heavy snow and lack of grass for cavalry
horses, most of the cavalry did not stay at the agencies.
Each camp was garrisoned by four companies of infantry,
one of cavalry, and a Gatling gun was left at each camp.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>
The other six cavalry companies returned to Fort Laramie
on March 16. Lieutenant Ray and the supply train left with
the returning cavalry to get another load of supplies for
the two garrisons at the agencies.</p>
<p>The garrisons left behind at the agencies began the
work of getting settled. By mutual agreement Spotted Tail
and Captain Lazelle, post commander at Camp Sheridan,
forbade intercamp visits at that agency. Lazelle had his
men dig rifle pits in front of their tent camp. Although
the Brule leaders Spotted Tail, Swift Bear, Standing Elk,
and Two Strike said they would not help the troops in the
event of war with the hostile faction, Colonel Smith reported
that the Brules at Spotted Tail Agency seemed resigned
to the presence of soldiers.</p>
<p>In contrast, Colonel Smith reported that a sullen attitude
towards soldiers persisted at Red Cloud Agency where
apparently even the friendly faction was being difficult.
When Dr. Saville ordered all friendly Indians to camp on
the south side of the White River he had to threaten the
loss of issue rations to enforce his order. The Indians declared
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
the north bank of the White River a deadline for
all white men, thus making necessary a longer wagon haul
for needed wood supplies.</p>
<p>The hostiles broke camp on Hat Creek and moved to
Spotted Tail Agency. Colonel Forsyth&rsquo;s official report of
the Sioux Expedition lists Lone Horn of the North, White
Bull, Roman Nose and Stooping Bear as the principal chiefs
among the northern Indians at Spotted Tail Agency. The
principal warriors among this faction were also listed by
Colonel Forsyth; they were Turtle Ribs, Thunder Hawk,
High Bear, Dog Back, and Crazy Horse.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> Despite the return
of the hostiles, the relative quiet at the agencies and
ease of occupation by the troops prompted General Sheridan
erroneously to predict &ldquo;any war we may have with Sioux
Indians will be simply the pursuit of small raiding parties.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<h3 id="c3">CAMP ROBINSON</h3>
<p>Difficulties continued at Red Cloud. Interpreter Rowland,
who had delivered Saville&rsquo;s message calling for troops,
attempted to conceal his part in the arrival of the Sioux Expedition
but was unable to do so. A Cheyenne, Crawls in
the Water, attempted to shoot Rowland but was himself
killed. Rowland fled to the military camp for protection,
and agency employees rescued his wife and children while
the hostiles burned his house and haystack.</p>
<p>The young warriors amused themselves by shooting
over the military tents and Colonel Smith warned that he
would attack the Indian village if any of his men were injured.
Troops from Camp Robinson generally carried arms,
and the daily wood train was under heavy escort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Gradually the Indians became more reconciled to the
presence of troops, and when the annual Sun Dance was
held at Red Cloud in the early summer, Lieutenant Carter
was able to arrange for J. Tavernier, a French artist employed
by <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, to attend the dance. Unfortunately,
lightning struck the sacred pole during the height
of the ceremonies. This was interpreted by the Indians as
supernatural disapproval of their visitors, and the artist
and officer hastily left the scene.</p>
<p>The infantry at Camp Robinson had their camp alongside
the agency stockade while Lt. Emmet Crawford&rsquo;s troop
of Third Cavalry camped a short distance away in the bottomlands
of the White River. By spring it was evident
that the location of Camp Robinson in close proximity to
Red Cloud Agency was not an ideal arrangement. Daily
contact invited friction between soldiers and Indian warriors,
but an even more serious problem was the lack of
sufficient grass for the cavalry horses. When warm weather
made the rotting refuse of butchered issue beef &ldquo;difficult
to bear&rdquo; the need for relocating the encampment became
critical. In May 1874 Colonel Smith moved Camp Robinson
a mile and a half west of the agency; there near the confluence
of Soldier Creek and the White River the permanent
post was later built. The troops remained in tents throughout
the first summer.</p>
<p>Soon after Camp Robinson was moved to its new site
the Indian warriors made an attack on the military encampment.
This very serious affair occurred as the result
of the arrest of an escaped convict, Toussaint Kenssler, by
Lieutenants Crawford and Ray at Red Cloud Agency. Kenssler
had escaped from a jail in Wyoming Territory and
hidden among his Indian friends. While at Red Cloud he
threatened the agent, his employees, and the Army officer
who had originally arrested him. He attempted to assault
a man who had been a witness during his trial and on one
occasion delayed the Camp Robinson mail carrier for several
hours. When the officers identified Kenssler they tried to
apprehend him. He attempted to escape and Lieutenant Ray
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
shot him through the legs. This action incensed many of
the Indians and the two officers experienced some tense
moments before they got their prisoner safely from the
agency to Camp Robinson.</p>
<p>About midnight the Indians made an attempt to rescue
the prisoner by attacking the military camp. The soldiers
formed a skirmish line and moved out towards the flashing
Indian guns. The warriors fell back in the face of the soldiers&rsquo;
gunfire and the troops withdrew to their camp only
to discover that their entire supply of beef on the hoof had
been driven off by other Indians during the brief engagement.
Lieutenant Crawford and the cavalry troop recovered
a large number of the stolen cattle.</p>
<p>The Kenssler affair was a demonstration that despite
the small size of the garrisons the troops were not going
to allow themselves to be intimidated by the Indian warriors.
Rifle target practice was held at Camp Robinson,
and at Camp Sheridan target practice with the Gatling gun
was held in July. Such impressive demonstrations of military
power must have had a tempering effect on the Indians
at the agency.</p>
<p>Other activities also occupied the post garrison. For
example, in July Lieutenant Crawford spent a great deal
of time giving assistance to homesteaders in the Loup Valley
of Nebraska where a serious plague of grasshoppers
struck.</p>
<p>Since neither of the two agencies was on the permanent
Sioux reservation, the military hesitated to begin construction
of winter quarters. An Indian commission headed by
Bishop Hare arrived to investigate the recent troubles at
the agency and to settle this problem, and during July and
August troops from Camp Robinson escorted the commissioners.
Bishop Hare decided that Red Cloud Agency would
remain at its White River location despite the fact that it
was not within the limits of the permanent reservation.
After considerable discussion Spotted Tail agreed to the relocation
of his agency and both the Spotted Tail Agency
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
and its associated military establishment, Camp Sheridan,
were moved to a more favorable site on Beaver Creek. With
the location question settled, the Army began construction
of permanent quarters for the troops.</p>
<p>In June 1874 Capt. W. H. Jordan and Companies A
and I of the Ninth Infantry arrived at Camp Robinson,
replacing Company F, Eighth Infantry and Company F of
the Fourteenth Infantry. Post Commander Jordan soon issued
orders to start cutting logs and to begin construction
of barracks. Ten wagons and sixty mules were employed
in hauling materials, and the sawmill at Red Cloud Agency
was made available for use by the troops. By November,
although barracks and urgently needed warehouses were
ready, only two sets of the adobe officers&rsquo; quarters were
completed. The post surgeon complained bitterly of &ldquo;criminal
neglect&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> when the delivery of heating stoves was unnecessarily
delayed.</p>
<p>The northern hostiles, absent during much of the summer,
began returning to Red Cloud Agency in October 1874
in anticipation of the issue of annuity goods in November.
With their arrival came new troubles at the agency, and
it almost seemed as if the agent was trying to create problems
for himself and the Army. Saville requested the aid
of the soldiers at Camp Robinson in arresting those responsible
for killing Frank Appleton the previous February, but
when he found that the military commander was instructed
that his function was to protect the agency and not to make
arrests, Saville gave up the idea. It was just as well that
military help was denied because an attempt to make such
an arrest would surely have had serious results.</p>
<p>Next Saville decided to erect a flagpole at the agency
and for this purpose had a tall pine cut and brought inside
the agency stockade. The chiefs were opposed to the flagpole,
but Saville did not take their objections seriously. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
northern faction was strongly opposed to the flagpole and
on October 23, 1874 a group of armed warriors entered the
agency stockade while Saville was inside his office talking
to Red Cloud and Red Dog. He was called out just in time
to see the flagpole being chopped to bits by the warriors,
led by the same men who had made him a prisoner in his
own office the year before.</p>
<p>Saville immediately sent a messenger to Camp Robinson
with a request for a troop of cavalry, but he neglected
to inform the commanding officer of the serious nature of
the disturbance then in progress. Shorthanded because some
of the cavalry were off on an escort mission, Captain Jordan
sent only twenty-two men, led by Lt. Emmet Crawford.
When Lieutenants Crawford and Steever and their men
reached the agency they were immediately surrounded by
some four hundred Indian warriors.</p>
<p>A group of Akicita or Indian camp police arrived on the
scene, led by Sitting Bull of the South who carried a distinctive
three-bladed club. These Indians rushed between
the troops and the angry warriors and with their clubs beat
the hostiles back, clearing a path so that the soldiers could
gain the safety of the agency stockade. Old Man Afraid of
His Horses then dispelled the crowd after a long harangue,
and several other agency leaders were helpful in preventing
further trouble.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>One report of the affair stated that flagpoles at Indian
agencies were both unusual and unnecessary. The flagpole
incident caused considerable ill feeling between the agent
and the military men, the latter believing the agent had
needlessly put the soldiers in a very serious position.</p>
<p>Whether or not it had anything to do with the flagpole
incident at Red Cloud Agency in 1874, the American flag
was not raised over Camp Robinson until Washington&rsquo;s
Birthday, 1876. The honor of raising the flag on that occasion
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
went to Sgt. John Kailey, Ninth Infantry, whose
twenty-seven years of service were the longest of any man
then stationed at the post.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Indian Agent Saville&rsquo;s efforts to get a count of the Indians
receiving supplies at Red Cloud were finally crowned
with success on November 30, 1874. Two factors combined
to produce this result. First, Saville announced that no more
rations would be issued until the Indians submitted to counting.
In the face of this threat Old Man Afraid of His Horses
changed his mind and counting began. He is also reported
to have compelled Red Cloud to withdraw his opposition.
The enumeration revealed a total of about 12,000 Indians:
9,339 Sioux, 1202 Cheyenne and 1092 Arapaho.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Events at the agency and the camp still did not go well.
Indian leaders were quick to sense the divided opinions of
various authorities and would complain to the Army officers
about the agent&rsquo;s handling of their affairs. When officers
listened, the agent regarded it as interference on the part
of the military. Many soldiers did not agree with the aims
and methods of the Grant Peace Policy of agency administration
under which various church groups nominated Indian
Agents. As one officer put it, the efforts were to &ldquo;civilize
these people immediately whether they are willing or
not. This may be good church theory but it is very impractical.
These Indians had better by far be left alone at
their agency than to be forced into hostilities by being
forced to accept civilization and a religion they can&rsquo;t understand
and don&rsquo;t want to understand.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> Another officer
assessed the plans to convert the Sioux to peaceful farmers
in the following way: &ldquo;... it is not easy to see how they
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
are to become farmers when they have no good farming
land to work on....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Red Cloud Agency had many visitors, including Professor
O. C. Marsh whose paleontological expedition into
the nearby fossil area was furnished with a military escort.
Professor Marsh was instrumental in focusing national attention
on Red Cloud Agency. In the course of securing
permission of the Indians to excavate fossils in their land
Marsh became acquainted with Chief Red Cloud. He was
given samples of particularly foul supplies which he was
told were normal issue goods. The professor&rsquo;s evidence of
frauds at the agency was given wide publicity, and Red
Cloud Agency became a political as well as a military hot-spot.
A full scale investigation of agency affairs followed,
and newspaper accounts of the hearings were full of possible
frauds by the supply and freight contractors. Although
Agent Saville was exonerated, he was removed from his post
and replaced by J. S. Hastings.</p>
<p>Although war with the Sioux had been a latent possibility
during some of the more serious difficulties at Red
Cloud Agency, it had been avoided. While incidents at the
agency failed to spark a general conflict, events not too far
off were developing into a situation which led to war with
the hostile Indians in 1876.</p>
<p>The Sidney Trail was developed to supply the agencies
and the military posts; it also became a major route to the
Black Hills following the discovery of gold there by the
Custer Expedition in 1874. Men from Camps Robinson and
Sheridan were called upon to check the illegal influx of
miners into the Black Hills, an area guaranteed to the Indians
by treaty. Although the soldiers frequently removed
parties from the Hills there were far too few troops to cope
with the situation. Soldiers from Camp Robinson took regular
turns at the base camp near Harney Peak, and at the
subpost on Hat Creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The Black Hills patrols from Camp Robinson produced
one of the heroic marches of the period. On the day after
Christmas, 1874, Capt. Guy V. Henry was ordered to take
his troop of Third Cavalry, accompanied by Lieutenant Carpenter
and fifteen men of the Ninth Infantry, to the Black
Hills in search of gold miners. They failed to find the miners,
but on their return the command was caught in a severe
blizzard and would have perished but for Captain
Henry&rsquo;s leadership. Nearly all of the men were badly
frozen and on their return to Camp Robinson in January
1875 the new additions brought the sick list to over 50 per
cent of the garrison. As late as January 20 Mr. Raymond,
the scout, was still in the hospital.</p>
<p>Some miners, like California Joe, served the Army as
scouts and used the time thus spent in the Black Hills to
prospect future claims. California Joe served as guide for
the 1875 Jenney geological expedition escorted by Col. R. I.
Dodge and eight companies of troops.</p>
<p>Indians were not the only persons contributing to the
troubles at Red Cloud Agency which occupied the attention
of the soldiers from Camp Robinson. Many horse thieves
such as &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Middleton&rsquo;s gang hung out in the area and
stole Indian mounts. The agency became &ldquo;a mighty tough
place&rdquo; according to George Colhoff, an employee at the
Yates Trading Company. It was a road agents&rsquo; rendezvous,
with men like Black Doak, Fly Speck Billy, Lame Johnny,
Paddy Simons, Tom Reed and Herman Leisner frequenting
the agency between their attacks on the stagecoaches traveling
the Sidney-Deadwood and Cheyenne-Deadwood trails.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Excitement still prevailed at Red Cloud Agency during
the winter of 1875-76 when the agent, Hastings, reported
considerable trouble with whiskey runners. Some of the
Army&rsquo;s valuable scouts, Big Bat Pourier and Frank Grouard,
were involved in fights at the agency as well. The camp
Robinson mail carriers were killed by Indians on December
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
25, 1876, and in the spring (1876) Indians not only ran off
the agency beef herd in broad daylight but killed Charles
Clarke, the civilian mail driver, near the White River.
Agency trader J. W. Dear recovered Clarke&rsquo;s body and
mentioned in a description of the affair that the Indians
had also run off stock at his ranch and attacked the wagon
train of the Yates Trading Company.</p>
<h3 id="c4">WAR WITH THE HOSTILE INDIANS</h3>
<p>The attempt by the Allison commission to purchase
the gold-rich Black Hills from the Sioux, in a treaty conference
near Camp Robinson in September 1875, developed
into another incident in the almost incredible series of near
disasters which plagued dealings with the Indians at Red
Cloud Agency.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the commission was held on September
17 in the council room of the agency, but the Indians
refused to attend, saying they would sign no treaty
under duress. Despite Spotted Tail&rsquo;s warnings of possible
trouble, the commission agreed to move the treaty site to
a point some eight miles east of Camp Robinson where a
meeting was held under a lone cottonwood tree. The assembled
throng of Indians numbered several thousand, with
large numbers from each of the several Sioux agencies.
A troop of cavalry lined each side of the canvas shelter
provided for the commissioners. Young Man Afraid of His
Horses ranged his friendly camp police behind the hostile
Indian warriors, and his assistance in the ensuing troubles
was credited with preventing disaster once again.</p>
<p>Both Red Cloud and Spotted Tail were scheduled to
speak in favor of selling the Black Hills but just as Red
Cloud began to make his oration Little Big Man, armed to
the teeth, threatened to shoot the first Indian who spoke
in favor of ceding the Black Hills to the white men. Spotted
Tail advised the commissioners to return to the safety of
Camp Robinson immediately&mdash;advice which they took.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The dismal failure of the treaty effort almost assured
a war with the hostile Sioux. The coming campaigns were
to be led by the Army&rsquo;s supreme Indian fighter, General
George Crook, who had taken command of the critical Department
of the Platte the previous spring and had immediately
set about to bring the companies of the Third Cavalry
up to full strength.</p>
<p>General Crook&rsquo;s first campaign against the hostiles
was no more successful than the Black Hills treaty efforts
had been. When cavalrymen led by Colonel Reynolds attacked
and managed to destroy the greater part of a hostile
camp on the Little Powder River on March 17, 1876
they were forced to withdraw rapidly from the captured
village. In an ensuing running fight the captured Indian
horse herd changed hands so many times that General
Crook had the remaining ponies killed to prevent their recapture.
The destruction of the property of one camp did
not drive the hostiles to the agencies in submission; if anything
it stiffened their resistance.</p>
<p>With the spring campaigns inconclusive, Crook prepared
for the summer. The summer campaign of 1876 was
designed to trap the hostiles between three columns: Gibbon
from the west, Terry and Custer from the east, and
Crook from the south. Crook&rsquo;s force numbered 1,774 men
and Terry had 1,873. To raise these columns all posts in
the Departments of the Platte and Dakota were stripped
of their garrisons. Crook&rsquo;s column met Crazy Horse and
the hostiles on June 17, 1876 in the Battle of Rosebud Creek
and, although the General claimed a victory when the Indians
left the field, he fell back to his base camp to await
reinforcements. On June 25 at the Little Big Horn, Sitting
Bull, Crazy Horse, and Black Moon led the same hostiles
and crushed Custer&rsquo;s command. Even before the Omaha
Military Headquarters had heard of Custer&rsquo;s defeat, the
Indians at Red Cloud Agency were discussing it. Frank
Yates, one of the traders at the agency, was a brother of
the Captain Yates who fell with Custer. When the rumors
were reported to him he went to Camp Robinson where
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
officers rejected the possibility of such a disaster. They
telegraphed Omaha but no word had yet reached officers
there.</p>
<p>On July 17, 1876, seventeen officers and 346 men of
the Fifth Cavalry commanded by Col. Wesley Merritt passed
through Camp Robinson on their way to reinforce Crook.
They paused long enough to intercept a group of about
eight hundred Cheyenne Indians who were leaving Red
Cloud Agency. The Indians claimed to be going on a buffalo
hunt, but it was feared that they were attempting to
join the victorious hostiles. Met by the troops, the Indians
were forced to return to the agency after a brief skirmish.
During the fighting Yellow Hand was killed by gunfire and
the scout &ldquo;Buffalo Bill&rdquo; Cody took his scalp in an incident
which was later much publicized and embellished.</p>
<p>The great Indian victories brought an end to the Peace
Policy, and on July 22, 1876 control of the Indian agencies
was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the
War Department and on June 31 Lt. O. Elting of Camp
Robinson became the acting agent at Red Cloud Indian
Agency. In August the officers discovered a serious shortage
in Indian Department funds and the Army had to loan
needed supplies for issue to the Indians at the agency.</p>
<p>Crook&rsquo;s column remained in the field throughout the
summer, following the battles of the Rosebud and the Little
Big Horn. In September, while marching towards the Black
Hills, Crook found that his supplies were exhausted, and
his men ate their dying mounts in the famed &ldquo;Horsemeat
March.&rdquo; A small detachment was sent ahead to obtain supplies.
Led by Capt. Anson Mills and including Lieutenant
Crawford of the Third Cavalry, the advance party discovered
and captured a Sioux camp in the Battle of Slim Buttes,
obtaining a considerable supply of meat. Additional supplies
were taken by troops from Camp Robinson to meet
the expedition in the Black Hills. Crook and his staff left
the troops, came in to Robinson, and went on to Fort Laramie.
On October 23 and 24, 1876 the men of his command
reached Camp Robinson, where the expedition was disbanded.
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
The sick and wounded were placed in the post
hospital, and Contract Surgeon Valentine T. McGillycuddy
was assigned to duty there.</p>
<p>Col. Ranald Mackenzie had come to Camp Robinson
with eight companies of cavalry in August. Mackenzie assumed
the command of the post and the additional troops
were quartered in three temporary cantonments. One of
these, Camp Canby, was the original Sioux Expedition cavalry
camp. The others were called Camp Custer and Camp
of the Second Battalion, Fourth Cavalry. In October groups
of recruits of 85 and 224 men arrived to bring the companies
up to strength. Colonel Forsyth reported some companies
consisted of nearly two-thirds recruits, owing to recent
discharges of disabled soldiers.</p>
<p>For the brief period when the men of both Crook&rsquo;s and
Mackenzie&rsquo;s commands were there, Camp Robinson and its
cantonments were very crowded. General Crook took advantage
of the temporary presence of the fifty-three companies
of troops at the post to hold a conference with Indian
leaders at Red Cloud Agency and in no uncertain terms
demanded loyal behavior of them.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of Mackenzie&rsquo;s forces, Red Cloud and
Red Leaf had moved their camps some twenty-five miles
away from the agency to Chadron Creek. In October, in
preparation for the coming winter campaign, Colonel Mackenzie
sent two battalions of cavalry and the newly arrived
Pawnee Scout battalion, led by Nebraskans, Frank and Luther
North, to disarm these bands and to prevent their
joining the hostiles. Two hundred thirty-nine Indians and
722 ponies were captured. The friendly Arapaho and Cut-Off
Sioux were not disarmed. Crook noted that this was
the first time in the history of Red Cloud Agency that the
friendly Indians were treated better than the stubborn ones.</p>
<p>Preparations for the winter campaign were observed
by a visiting delegation of Japanese army officers at Camp
Robinson before Crook and Mackenzie moved their forces
to Fort Fetterman where the campaign would begin. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the meantime General Miles transported fresh troops to the
northern plains by Missouri River steamboat. Miles fought
several engagements with Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.
Crook sent Mackenzie and the cavalry and Pawnee Scouts on
ahead of his main column and in late November they routed
and destroyed Dull Knife&rsquo;s Cheyenne village, moving relentlessly
to crush the hostiles&rsquo; resistance.</p>
<p>In September 1876, long before the winter victories,
the successful purchase of the Black Hills was negotiated
by a new commission headed by George Manypenny. This
Black Hills treaty was signed at Red Cloud Agency September
26. The commission met the Indians at each agency
separately, thus depriving them of the solidarity of numbers.
It also took advantage of the fact that the hostiles
were not present to create confusion. The Indians later
claimed that the use of whiskey, bribes, threats of loss of
all rations and false impressions of the terms of the treaty
were methods employed by the commission, and the validity
of the treaty was questioned. The treaty of 1868 had provided
for a specific proportion of signatures to validate future
treaties, and in 1876 only forty Indian signatures were
obtained at Red Cloud, whereas it was later estimated some
2,267 were needed. However, the Black Hills passed to U.S.
ownership.</p>
<h3 id="c5">THE HOSTILES SURRENDER</h3>
<p>The winter successes of the Crook-Mackenzie and Miles
campaigns foreshadowed the end of the Sioux War. In
April one thousand Sioux hostiles led by Touch the Clouds
surrendered at Spotted Tail Agency and Dull Knife brought
his Cheyenne in to Camp Robinson. The final total of hostiles
who surrendered at Camps Robinson and Sheridan
reached almost 4,500 people.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Emissaries to the hostile camps brought back word
that Crazy Horse was on the way in and on May 6, 1877
he and his followers, 889 men, women and children, surrendered
at Camp Robinson. They gave up some 2,000
ponies, and the 217 men turned in 117 guns and pistols.
The impressive surrender march of Crazy Horse&rsquo;s band
was described by the officer who met the hostiles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Sioux Chief Crazy Horse came in and surrendered
in 1877, he formed all of his warriors in line, in
advance of the women and children; then, in front of this
line, also mounted, he had some ten of his headmen; and
then in front of these he rode alone. I had been sent with
Indian scouts to meet him. He sent me word requesting a
similar formation on our part, and asked that I should ride
on in advance alone. Then we were to dismount and first
shake hands, while seated on the ground, that the peace
might be solid. After all this had been done his headmen
came up, the peacepipe was produced, and we solemnly
smoked. One of his headmen put a scalp-jacket and war-bonnet
on me, and presented me the pipe with which peace
had been made.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What to do with the surrendering hostiles was a problem.
Crazy Horse and some of the other warriors were enrolled
as scouts, and a grand review was held for General
Crook. Nevertheless, in General Sheridan&rsquo;s opinion these
hostiles should be given the same treatment as troublesome
Kiowa and Cheyenne warriors who had been imprisoned at
Fort Marion, near St. Augustine, Florida, following previous
campaigns.</p>
<p>Too, Crazy Horse acted in a manner which aroused
suspicion on the part of the military authorities at Camp
Robinson. The soldiers described his attitude as sullen and
restless despite his expressed desire to live peacefully. Some
chiefs of the agency bands also found his increasing popularity
among their followers a threat to their positions.</p>
<p>Indian opposition to Crazy Horse was intensified after
a council with seventy leaders was held at Red Cloud Agency
on July 27, 1877. General Crook sent word that the Indians
were free to go on the forty day buffalo hunt he had promised
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
them, and they in turn were to give their word to
return to the agency after the hunt. A delegation to Washington,
D. C. was also discussed. A feast was a usual part
of such an important meeting, and when Young Man Afraid
of His Horses suggested that the feast be held at the camp
of Crazy Horse and Little Big Man no one objected, but Red
Cloud and his followers left the council room. Later that
night the Red Cloud faction voiced their objections to feasting
at Crazy Horse&rsquo;s camp to Agent Irwin. They said Crazy
Horse was unreconstructed, tricky, unfaithful and waiting
for his chance to escape from the agency. Because the
possibility that the hostiles would flee, rejoin Sitting Bull
in Canada, and begin the war anew was not a pleasant prospect,
the buffalo hunt was cancelled as a precautionary
measure.</p>
<p>Crazy Horse had continued to speak in favor of the
new northern agency for his people once promised by General
Crook. This was contrary to the 1877 government plan
to move the agencies to the Missouri River where supplies
could be more economically delivered by river boat, an arrangement
favored by army officers.</p>
<p>Crazy Horse further alienated the Army, now involved
in a new Indian campaign, this time the outbreak of Chief
Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe. Efforts were made to obtain
Indian scouts for the new campaign from among the
former hostiles at Red Cloud Agency. At first Crazy Horse
opposed their enlistment on the grounds that they would
be used to fight Sitting Bull and their Sioux friends rather
than Chief Joseph&rsquo;s people. Finally Crazy Horse consented
to fight the Nez Perce but Frank Grouard, acting as interpreter,
made an error in translation and reported that Crazy
Horse said he would fight until not a white man was left.
Whether this error was an honest mistake or a deliberate
one,<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> the mistranslation reinforced the rumors that Crazy
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
Horse planned to murder Crook and other officers and that
he planned to go on the warpath again. General Crook directed
that the famed warrior be apprehended and &ldquo;sent
out of harms way.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>A cavalry battalion from Camp Robinson and a large
party of Indians (including Crazy Horse&rsquo;s personal enemy,
No Water, with whom he had had a squabble over a woman)
rode to Crazy Horse&rsquo;s camp nearby to arrest him. They
succeeded in capturing many of his band, but Crazy Horse
escaped and fled to Spotted Tail Agency, seeking refuge in
the camp of his friend Touch the Clouds. His arrival caused
considerable excitement in that camp, but loyal Brules interceded
and restored order. Touch the Clouds and about
300 warriors then escorted Crazy Horse towards Camp Sheridan.
Halfway there they were met by Lt. J. M. Lee, acting
agent at Spotted Tail Agency, two other officials, and an
interpreter. Just as this group reached the post parade
ground Chief Spotted Tail arrived with an equally large
number of his Brule warriors. This support for the small
Camp Sheridan garrison turned the balance in their favor.
With Spotted Tail backing the Americans, Crazy Horse apparently
realized his position was not a strong one.</p>
<p>The crowd finally was dispersed and Lee and a few
others had a conference with Crazy Horse who explained
his desire to transfer to the Spotted Tail Agency. An attempt
was made by interpreter Louis Bordeaux to correct
Grouard&rsquo;s mistranslation of Crazy Horse&rsquo;s statement about
fighting the Nez Perce. Lieutenant Lee and Major Burke
assured Crazy Horse that he would not be harmed. In response
to Lee&rsquo;s persuasion Crazy Horse agreed to return to
Camp Robinson the next day on condition that he be allowed
to explain how he had been misunderstood and misinterpreted
and that he wanted peace, not trouble. By this
time, however, most officers, particularly those at Camp
Robinson, completely distrusted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>On their arrival at Camp Robinson, the post commander,
Colonel Bradley, refused to hold a council with
Crazy Horse despite Lee&rsquo;s efforts to arrange one. Bradley&rsquo;s
orders gave him no alternative except to imprison Crazy
Horse, and an effort was made to put him in the guardhouse.
When he saw the cells inside Crazy Horse drew a
knife and attempted to free himself but he was bayoneted
by one of the guards during the struggle. Little Big Man
was injured while trying to restrain Crazy Horse. Both
friendly and hostile Indians were in the excited crowd of
witnesses, and the friendly Indians prevented Crazy Horse&rsquo;s
friends from firing at the guard. When another attempt
to put the mortally wounded warrior into the guardhouse
was made, the Indians seemed so close to an outbreak that
Colonel Bradley reluctantly agreed to Surgeon McGillycuddy&rsquo;s
suggested compromise and Crazy Horse was taken
next door to the adjutant&rsquo;s office where he died shortly
before midnight on September 5, 1877.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Great excitement developed among the Indians around
Camp Robinson as a result of the killing of Crazy Horse
and serious trouble was threatened, but the efforts of Indian
leaders prevented a violent outbreak. In a report of
the incident Lt. W. P. Clarke listed the Arapaho, Black Coal
and Sharp Nose, and the Sioux leaders Red Cloud, Young
Man Afraid of His Horses, American Horse, Yellow Bear,
Little Big Man, Big Road, No Water, Three Bears, and No
Flesh as the men who prevented an outbreak by controlling
their people. That so important a man as Crazy Horse could
be killed in such a way without any more serious consequences
than a few days uproar was an indication that the
war with the Sioux was about over.</p>
<p>After Crazy Horse was killed the plan to relocate Red
Cloud Agency on the Missouri River went ahead rapidly.
On October 25, 1877 the move was begun, with troops from
Camp Robinson escorting the Red Cloud Indians and those
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
from Camp Sheridan escorting the Spotted Tail Indians and
the hostiles of the late Crazy Horse&rsquo;s camp. Although seemingly
subdued, the hostiles still managed to embarrass the
soldiers. Before the two columns had proceeded very far
the northern Indians broke away from the Spotted Tail
column and joined the Red Cloud group. Then they broke
away from that column, and, carrying Crazy Horse&rsquo;s bones,
fled north to join Sitting Bull in Canada, pausing on the
way to raid in the Black Hills and along the Bismarck stage
line. The first report was that some 1,700 Indians had escaped,
but a recheck cut the figure to 800.</p>
<p>The soldiers from Camp Robinson who escorted the
Indians built and formed the garrison of a military post at
New Red Cloud Agency,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> but the new location was used
for only a short time. The Oglala refused to go to the new
agency site and set up their camp seventy-five miles away.
In 1878 the government gave up the Missouri River plan
and the agency was moved west again to become the present
Pine Ridge Agency about fifty miles northeast of Fort Robinson
in South Dakota.</p>
<h3 id="c6">GARRISON LIFE</h3>
<p>Camp Robinson was renamed Fort Robinson in January
1878. It remained an important post and its garrison was
called upon in several Indian emergencies after the death
of Crazy Horse.</p>
<p>Garrison life was normal at the post, with the officers&rsquo;
families joining them as soon as quarters were available.
The first women to come to live at Camp Robinson in the
winter of 1874-1875 were the wives of Capt. W. H. Jordan,
the post commander, and Lt. J. M. Lee, both Ninth Infantry
officers.</p>
<p>Social activities included picnics, walks to the nearby
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
buttes, long horseback rides, visits to Indian camps and
dances, and fossil hunting in the nearby Bad Lands. Company
dances were held with some regularity and social calling
was an important part of the daily routine of officers
and their ladies. Not all of the women were well impressed
by the post. When Surgeon Valentine T. McGillycuddy&rsquo;s
wife joined him at Camp Robinson on December 13, 1876
she noted in her diary: &ldquo;Commenced enjoying the camp.
Finished.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> Mrs. McGillycuddy later tempered this first
judgment of the post with diary entries that indicate her
enjoyment of horseback rides and social calls by such notables
as General Crook. Surgeon McGillycuddy&rsquo;s wife even
went along with her husband and a detachment of troops
on an extended stay in the Black Hills in 1877.</p>
<p>The officers often entertained prominent Indian chiefs
like Spotted Tail and Red Cloud, inviting such leaders to
join them for lunch. Lt. John G. Bourke, General Crook&rsquo;s
aide, spent hours learning Indian languages from his native
friends. Bourke once had an amusing contest with the
Cheyenne medicine man High Wolf. Lieutenant Bourke
used an old static electricity generator to deliver a shock
to Indians he tempted to reach into a pail of water. The
trap was baited with coins. In imitation of songs sung by
Indian medicine men, Bourke sang &ldquo;Pat Malloy&rdquo; while operating
the generator and acquired a reputation for having
powerful &ldquo;medicine.&rdquo; A challenge match was arranged to
test the relative powers of Bourke and High Wolf. There
was a liberal prize and side bets by spectators. High Wolf
received such a strong electrical charge on his first attempt
that he fell and damaged Bourke&rsquo;s machine. He
shrewdly demanded a second chance and won the contest.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the post surgeon, medical care
was sometimes inadequate to cope with the hazards of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
frontier; an August whooping cough epidemic in 1876
claimed the lives of two children at Camp Robinson and
was much more severe in the nearby Indian camps. The
post surgeon noted in his medical history that &ldquo;among the
remedies employed vaccination has seemed to be very serviceable.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Some deaths at Fort Robinson were due to disease or
natural causes, while others were the result of violence. The
first burial at Camp Robinson, on July 3, 1875, was that of
Pvt. James Brogan, Company A, Ninth Infantry, who died
of &ldquo;congestion of the brain.&rdquo; Several victims of gunfights
were also buried in the post cemetery. In 1876 &ldquo;California
Joe&rdquo; (Moses Milner), a civilian hired as a scout for the
Mackenzie expedition, was shot and killed by Tom Newcomb.
The killing was the result of the scout&rsquo;s efforts to
publicly blame Newcomb for a murder he himself had probably
committed. Sgt. Frank Owens, Ninth Infantry, killed
Pvt. Eugene Carlton of his company while at a ranch nearby,
and Surgeon McGillycuddy was unable to save the life
of a Sergeant Casey mortally wounded by a trooper at Camp
Canby.</p>
<p>The main center of entertainment for the men of the
garrison was the post trader&rsquo;s store and saloon. When the
Sioux Expedition first established Camp Robinson, Mr. John
T. Collins, post trader at Fort Laramie, was appointed acting
trader by the expedition commander Col. John Smith.
Later Major Paddock became post trader at Camp Robinson
and held the position until the 1890&rsquo;s. In efforts to control
the results of drinking sprees which accounted for most of
the courtmartial offenses, the post trader at Camp Robinson
was required to keep a list of men buying drinks. Enlisted
men were allowed only two drinks a day and those
were to be three hours apart. Unauthorized sources of
whiskey and entertainment, available just off the military
reservation, made enforcement of this rule difficult. Holidays
were marked by excesses among officers as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
enlisted men; Mrs. McGillycuddy&rsquo;s diary records, in connection
with the New Year period in 1876, &ldquo;Outfit all drunk.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>Standards of discipline changed with commanding officers.
When he became post commander at Camp Robinson
Colonel Mackenzie directed that the officers&rsquo; billiard room
in the post trader&rsquo;s store would be closed and no cards or
billiards would be played on Sundays. Court-martials of enlisted
men were frequent and punishment sometimes went
beyond simple hard labor. One thirty day sentence provided
that for twelve days the prisoner was to &ldquo;stand on a barrel
from reveille to retreat allowing one half hour for each
meal.&rdquo; Some sentences were for relatively minor infractions.
At Camp Sheridan a musician was court-martialed
for disobeying an order relative to the key in which he
played &ldquo;First Call.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> Men of the garrison worked six days
a week, their routine beginning and ending with the rising
and setting sun. On Sunday morning there was a full dress
parade and inspection.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Beef and bread, supplemented by wild game and vegetables
grown by the soldiers in company gardens, were the
main items of diet, although the issued foods included pork,
bacon, flour, cornmeal, beans, peas, rice, hominy, coffee,
sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. Beef was often eaten twice
a day; steak for breakfast and roast for lunch, with the
evening meal consisting of pancakes or stewed dried apples.
Both officers and men could purchase additional foods at
the post commissary which carried canned tomatoes, raisins,
hams and other items. In addition to post trader Paddock&rsquo;s
store at Camp Robinson, Clay Dear&rsquo;s store at Camp
Canby and J. W. Dear&rsquo;s at Red Cloud Agency were sources
of delicacies. Mrs. McGillycuddy describes her efforts to
obtain oysters from these suppliers.</p>
<p>A major problem of the Army during the Indian Wars
was desertion. Some men enlisted merely to obtain shelter
for the winter or transportation to the West and others
became dissatisfied with the rigors of Army life. In contrast
were the enlisted men who devoted their lives to the
service and formed the noncommissioned core of the Army.
Sergeants and corporals often had to back up their commands
with more than their chevrons when dealing with
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
unruly members of the ranks. One sergeant of the guard
at Fort Robinson so stoutly enforced his commands that
the recalcitrant private died of a fractured skull.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> The sergeant&rsquo;s
action was vindicated by a court inquiry.</p>
<p>The officers were an experienced group and devoted
to an Army career. Many had risen, like Guy V. Henry, to
the rank of general during the Civil War, only to revert to
their regular rank when the Army was reduced to its
&ldquo;peacetime&rdquo; Indian War size of about 25,000 men. Others
came &ldquo;up from the ranks,&rdquo; as Emmet Crawford who fought
through the War between the States as an enlisted man
and noncom and was then commissioned. John G. Bourke
graduated from West Point after serving through the Civil
War as a private.</p>
<p>Promotion was slow in the small army of the Indian
War period. It was not at all unusual to spend a decade or
more as a lieutenant, and an equal period faced a new captain
before he could hope to become a field officer. The
families of officers and enlisted men alike shared the rigors
and isolation of frontier service. The years of campaigning
against hostile Indians required a devotion to duty
of the highest order.</p>
<h3 id="c7">CRUSHING THE LAST INDIAN RESISTANCE</h3>
<p>In August 1877 Dull Knife and the Northern Cheyenne
who had surrendered at Camp Robinson were taken to Indian
Territory. During the next twelve months they suffered
greatly from lack of food and from diseases to which
they had no natural immunity. The Cheyenne had reluctantly
accepted removal to Indian Territory on a trial basis,
but when they requested permission to return north it was
refused in spite of their hardships. On September 8, 1878
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
they took matters into their own hands when, led by Dull
Knife and Little Wolf, they began their almost unbelievable
march back to their northern homeland. Their bid for
freedom is one of the epics of the frontier.</p>
<p>Leaving their tipis standing, the Cheyenne slipped
away from the troops guarding them near Fort Reno and
proceeded to fight their way across Oklahoma, Kansas, and
Nebraska, pursued by thousands of infantry and cavalry
soldiers. The Indians fought several sharp skirmishes with
the troops and managed to elude capture, breaking through
lines of intercepting troops along the Kansas Pacific and
the Union Pacific Railroads. General Crook ordered General
Bradley at Fort Robinson to form a third line of defense.
Along with soldiers from Camp Sheridan and other posts
the Fort Robinson garrison patrolled the sandhills area of
Nebraska. Finally a group of 149 men, women and children
led by Dull Knife were met and taken into custody by Captain
Johnson&rsquo;s Company from Fort Robinson.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne had planned to seek refuge among their
Sioux friends at Red Cloud Agency, not knowing that it had
been relocated. They did not want to go to Fort Robinson,
but when additional troops and artillery were brought up
the Cheyenne were convinced that resistance was useless.</p>
<p>The Indians were taken to the post and imprisoned in
the log cavalry barracks at the southeast corner of the parade
ground. From their capture in October 1878 until
January 1879 the Indians lived at the Fort. Little Wolf
and the remaining Cheyenne stayed nearby for some time,
then completed their escape to the northern Plains. That
group did not surrender for several more months.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne held at Fort Robinson were told that
they would have to return to Indian Territory to live on
the reservation there. Dull Knife, speaking for his people,
said they had returned to their homeland and that they
would be killed there rather than return south. In January
efforts were made to starve them into submission, and a
few of the men were taken prisoner during conferences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>The Indians decided to try to escape. On the night of
January 9, 1879 the Cheyenne Outbreak began. Using the
few guns they had managed to hide when they were disarmed
and imprisoned the previous October, the warriors
opened fire on the soldiers guarding their barracks prison.
The guards were killed or wounded, and their arms and
ammunition captured by the Cheyenne. While the women
and children fled towards the river the men fought a stiff
delaying action against the hastily aroused garrison. Troops
sleeping in nearby barracks went into action in the bitter
cold clad only in their underclothing, engaging the fleeing
Indians until the cavalry could mount and ride to the scene.
Many Cheyenne fell between the parade ground and the
sawmill by the river, but some escaped to the hills behind
the post.</p>
<p>The Fort Robinson soldiers spent the next two weeks
pursuing the Cheyenne in the rough butte country west of
the post. Each day their quarry eluded capture. Both the
Cheyenne and the soldiers suffered additional casualties in
these encounters. On January 22 the last of the Indians
were killed or captured.</p>
<p>About sixty-four Cheyenne died in the outbreak and
many others were wounded before being captured. Eleven
soldiers were killed and ten wounded along with the Sioux
Indian scout, Woman&rsquo;s Dress. In the medical history Post
Surgeon E. B. Mosely wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During this whole period the fighting was of the most
desperate character being from a hand to hand struggle up
to a range almost always inside of fifty yards. The great
proportion of fatal wounds is remarkable and their concentration
on the trunk of the body shows a deliberation and
skill in handling the improved breech-loading arms with
which they were liberally supplied, a fact which explains
why this particular tribe enjoyed the reputation of being
the best warriors on the Plains. The conduct of the white
troops is worthy of the greatest praise. Taken by surprise
the first night, they rallied in the most prompt manner and
followed the flying enemy even barefooted in the deep
snow with thermometer at 10&deg; F. until ordered back by
their officers.</p>
<p>In the final charge the men advanced under a heavy
and fatal fire to the edge of the hole in which the enemy
were hidden and in a few minutes of short work finished
the affair.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>By an unfortunate fatality a large number of the killed
were of the very best and most respected men of the command.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the number of casualties and intensity of
the fighting the Cheyenne Outbreak can be regarded as one
of the major battles of the Indian Wars,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> Many of the
Cheyenne had been fighting for, rather than against, the
Army only two years before. &ldquo;Among these Indians,&rdquo; wrote
General Crook &ldquo;were some of the bravest and most efficient
of the auxiliaries who have acted under General Mackenzie
and myself in the campaign against the hostile Sioux in
1876 and 1877, and I still preserve a grateful remembrance
of their distinguished services of which the government
seems to have forgotten.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>When the Indians were removed from northwestern
Nebraska, ranchers moved in and established big cattle
ranches in the desirable lands by 1878. The Graham, Bronson
and Newman ranches were some of the first established,
but their uncontested hold on the free range was of relatively
short duration.</p>
<p>The Freemont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad
which reached Fort Robinson in 1886 stimulated settlement.
So many homesteaders followed the railroad that the post
commander at Fort Robinson was forced to carefully mark
the boundaries of the military wood reserve to prevent its
settlement. Rancher-homesteader conflicts developed, but
the presence of Fort Robinson was a big factor in preventing
a large scale range war. The Fort was also a source
of assistance to the settlers. For example, &ldquo;Old Jules&rdquo; Sandoz
was treated in the post hospital by the Surgeon, Walter
Reed. The town of Crawford was founded at the boundary
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
of the Fort Robinson reservation and profited from military
business.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>A typical &ldquo;wild-west&rdquo; town, Crawford and its entertainment
facilities caused many a headache for the post
commander who was forced to cancel the practice of allowing
the cavalrymen to have &ldquo;mounted&rdquo; passes during off-duty
hours. One Ninth Cavalryman was sentenced to a year
at hard labor for riding his horse into a Crawford saloon
during a &ldquo;frolic.&rdquo; In 1906 a 10th cavalry trooper killed Art
Moss, one of the town&rsquo;s law officers, in a gunfight. During
one eighteen month period three soldiers from the post, one
a holder of the Congressional Medal of Honor, were murdered
in the vicinity. All three crimes went unpunished.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>The arrival of the railroad at Fort Robinson not only
brought settlers to the area but it brought about the end
of a famous military post, Fort Laramie. Fort Robinson
was easier to supply by rail and it was closer to the Sioux
reservation at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The expansion
of Fort Robinson began in 1887 and Fort Laramie was ultimately
abandoned in 1890. The expansion of Fort Robinson
resulted in a change in its function and it became a regimental
headquarters cavalry post.</p>
<p>Actually the summer of 1885 saw the beginning of this
change at Fort Robinson, when the first elements of the
Ninth Cavalry arrived to garrison the post. The Ninth was
one of the Army&rsquo;s two all-Negro cavalry regiments.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> The
men of the Ninth continued the routine tasks of repairing
telegraph lines, patrolling the area, and pursuing stage-coach
and train robbers as well as carrying out their usual
military training.</p>

<p>In August 1889 a Camp of Instruction was held at Fort
Robinson. This event attracted a great deal of attention
because it involved the assembly at the post of all troops
in the Department of the Platte. The vast encampment
was organized by General Brooke under the direction of
General Crook, then commanding the Military Division of
the Missouri. Training for the 102 officers and 2,155 enlisted
men began on August 20 and lasted for one month.
The fifty-eight participating companies came from eleven
different posts in the Department and consisted of the Ninth
Cavalry, the Fifth Artillery and the Second, Seventh,
Eighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Twenty-first Infantry
regiments. The soldiers lived in a tent camp about a mile
from the main post at Fort Robinson, their temporary quarters
being named Camp George Crook.</p>
<p>The expansion of Fort Robinson proved to be timely,
for 1890-91 brought new Indian troubles and field service
for the garrison. Discouraged by reservation life and hoping
to bring back their old nomadic ways by supernatural
methods, the Sioux took up the Ghost Dance. Ghost Dancers
wore cloth shirts which they believed gave them supernatural
protection against bullets, and during the course of
their dancing they fell in trances and had visions of the
spirit world in which they often talked to long dead relatives.
Indian agents and civilians nearby became concerned
lest the Indian wars begin again.</p>
<p>In October 1890 the post commander Colonel Tilford
informed the Indian agent at Pine Ridge, Dr. D. F. Royer,
that if troops were needed they would be sent from Fort
Robinson, but the Colonel suggested that the Indians should
be allowed to dance as long as they harmed no one. A similar
opinion was held by the post scout, Little Bat, who believed
that the Ghost Dance would eventually die out if
left alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>By November Agent Royer was even more apprehensive
about the Ghost Dance and came to Fort Robinson for
a conference. In view of the mounting concern, the Ninth
Cavalry was given orders to leave, by railroad, for Pine
Ridge on November 19. While in the field in connection
with the Ghost Dance troubles the Ninth Cavalry was under
the command of Major Guy V. Henry, the same officer
who, as a company commander in the Third Cavalry, had
figured prominently in the history of Camp Robinson during
the Indian War days.</p>
<p>Fort Robinson served as a stop en route for recruits
sent to join their various regiments in the field at Pine
Ridge. Carbines and other supplies were also forwarded
from the post when needed.</p>
<p>The Ghost Dance troubles culminated in the Battle of
Wounded Knee on December 29, 1890. Casualties in this
battle were quite heavy, both among the troopers of the
Seventh Cavalry and the Indian men, women and children
of Big Foot&rsquo;s band. Fort Robinson&rsquo;s post scout, Little Bat,
acted as an interpreter and helped to disarm the Indians
when the well known battle began.</p>
<p>Under Major Henry&rsquo;s leadership the Ninth Cavalry
made several long forced marches at the height of the troubles
and although they did not see action in the battle of
Wounded Knee they did fight a skirmish a few days later
when, in classic movie style, they arrived on the scene in
time to save elements of another regiment which were surrounded
and under attack. The Ghost Dance trouble was
the last bloody chapter in the wars with the Sioux.</p>
<h3 id="c9">FORT ROBINSON SINCE 1890</h3>
<p>After the Battle of Wounded Knee the Ghost Dance
trouble ended, and garrison life at Fort Robinson settled
back to training, garden tending, and policing the post,
with few breaks in the routine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>In 1892 the Ninth Cavalry, accompanied by post scouts
Little Bat Garnier, Woman&rsquo;s Dress, Yankton Charlie, White
Antelope, and Joe Mosseau, spent the months from June
until October in the field at Camp Bettens, Wyoming.</p>
<p>In 1897 an interesting report on recent minor tactical
maneuvers at Fort Robinson was submitted. It described
the mounting of Lt. M. A. Batson and two enlisted men on
high wheel Columbia bicycles and the results of a rugged
test of their ability to keep pace with mounted troops in
the field. The bicycle-mounted men had &ldquo;great difficulty&rdquo;
in keeping up with cavalry in rough terrain but over rolling
ground were able to outdistance the horsemen. However,
the report concluded that day in and day out the bicycle
men would not be able to perform as required. One of the
Columbia wheels was wrecked during the test. Lt. Batson
later used another of the bicycles to good effect while mapping
parts of the military reservation. Despite its humorous
aspect, this test foreshadowed the eventual replacement of
cavalry by mechanized troops.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>The war with Spain brought orders on April 16, 1898
for the Ninth Cavalry to move to Chicamauga Park,
Georgia; it later went to Cuba and then on to the Philippine
Islands. In a flurry of activity Fort Robinson was stripped,
not only of troops, but of artillery and other needed war
material, and the garrison was reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>After the war the Tenth, Eighth, and Twelfth Cavalry
regiments, in that order, followed the Ninth as the Fort
Robinson garrison. On December 16, 1900, Little Bat Garnier,
the post scout who had served the Army so well since
1876, was shot and killed by a barkeeper in Crawford. He
was buried in the post cemetery at Fort Robinson.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>In 1906 Fort Robinson was once again involved in Indian
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
trouble. Col. J. A. Augur, regimental commander of
the Tenth Cavalry, had to order troops from the garrison
to take the field when three hundred Ute Indians fled their
reservation in an effort to relocate themselves in the Big
Horn country of Montana. The Fort Robinson troops intercepted
the Ute and escorted them to Fort Meade, South
Dakota.</p>
<p>During World War I activity at Fort Robinson was
reduced. A Signal Corps Training Center was planned for
the Fort, but the war ended before it could be established.</p>
<p>After the war, in 1919, the post became a Quartermaster
Remount Depot. It eventually developed into the
world&rsquo;s largest remount station, with thousands of horses
and mules. At the Remount Depot horses were received,
conditioned, and issued to Army units and civilian breeders.
Some breeding of horses was also carried on at the post as
a breeder&rsquo;s demonstration as well as to prove certain stallions.
Many famous race horses were at the depot after
their racing careers ended and the 1936 U. S. Olympic
Equestrian team trained at the Fort Robinson Remount
Depot.</p>
<p>Officers of the Remount service belonged to the Soldier
Creek Hunt Club and hunted coyotes with their pack of
Welch, English and French stag hounds. The men of the
post during this period were proud of their extensive swine
and dairy herds and flocks of poultry maintained to add
variety to their regular rations, just as the troops of the
garrison during the Indian wars raised much of their own
food.</p>
<p>The Fourth Field Artillery battalion joined the Remount
Service at Fort Robinson from 1928 until 1932. The
artillery men made extensive tests of pack artillery organization
and equipment such as the Phillips pack saddle. One
such test was a five hundred mile march to the Black Hills
and return, during which they hauled a mountain howitzer
to the top of Harney Peak.</p>
<p>In World War II Fort Robinson&rsquo;s remount activities
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
were continued and expanded, and thousands of horses and
mules were conditioned for military service. The post made
other contributions to the war effort as well. The Fort
Robinson War Dog Reception and Training Center was activated
on October 3, 1942, and on March 15, 1943 a Prisoner
of War Camp was added.</p>
<p>There were kennels for 2,000 dogs and over 6,000 canine
patients were treated in the special dog hospital before
the installation was closed in September 1946. War
dogs were trained for several types of duty, including sentry,
trail, tactical, sledge, pack and hospital service. The
internment camp had space for 3,000 German prisoners of
war. Only one prisoner escaped from the camp, and he was
recaptured in York, Nebraska.</p>
<h3 id="c10">BUILDING FORT ROBINSON</h3>
<p>Several building periods can be identified in the development
of Fort Robinson. The following description of the
old post was written when it was under construction in
1874.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The camp is 160 yards square. Officers&rsquo; quarters are
on the north, infantry barracks on the east and west and
cavalry barracks, guard house and storehouse on the south
sides. The barracks are built of logs, in panels of 15 feet
each. For the infantry they are two in number, each 150
by 24 feet by 9 feet high to the eaves, divided in the center
to accommodate two companies. They have a shed extension
at the rear, 12 feet wide, the length of the building,
partitioned off for mess-rooms, kitchens and wash rooms.
The cavalry barrack is built in the same way, but only 90
feet long, for the accommodation of one company with
mess-room and kitchen like the others. These buildings
are unceiled, have shingle roofs, log walls, window sashes
and are floored. One building 142 by 24 feet, 8&frac14; feet to
eaves, and from eaves to ridge 7&frac12; feet, is built of logs,
with shingle roof, and divided into twelve sets of two
rooms each, and occupied as quarters for married soldiers
and laundresses.</p>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s quarters are to be all alike, six sets being
authorized each 38 feet long by 32 feet wide and 10 feet
high, one for the commanding officer and five for company
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
officers. They have stone foundations,<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> walls of adobe
[bricks] and are to be ceiled by boards and plastered. In
each building there are to be four rooms, 15 feet square,
with a central hall, four feet wide. The dining rooms and
kitchens in the rear are to be made of lumber.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warehouses, stables, and other buildings of the
early post were constructed of logs, log slabs, or boards.
The first post hospital, a log building, was not completed
until November 1875, tents and dugouts being used to house
the sick and the post surgeon until that time. In addition
to the military buildings there was a post trader&rsquo;s residence
and store-saloon, and next to it a small log building housing
a photographer&rsquo;s studio.</p>
<p>The beginning of the new decade in the 1880&rsquo;s saw
some expansion of the post with the construction of another
log barracks, an adobe barracks for the band, and a residence
for the band leader. The replacement of the log hospital
by a concrete structure and other additions were all
made before 1886. In 1887 expansion of Fort Robinson,
connected with projected reduction of Fort Laramie, took
place on a newly established parade ground, northwest of
the original one, along the north side of which was constructed
a series of duplex adobe brick officers&rsquo; quarters,
six in number. On the opposite side, adobe brick barracks
were built, and beyond them new frame cavalry stables.
The post commander, Col. Edward Hatch, wanted to use
fired brick for the new quarters but was overruled despite
the equality of cost and the superior quality of fired brick.
Only a year later a forty hour storm caused the unprotected
walls of some of the adobe houses to collapse. However,
once repaired, they proved durable and are still in use today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>In the early 1890&rsquo;s Fort Robinson was further expanded
with the construction of additional officers&rsquo; quarters in
1891, and the following year more storehouses and a much
needed replacement for the old guardhouse were added. New
gun sheds, quartermaster stables, wheelwright and blacksmith
shops also were built in the 1890&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>During this period there were so many families of
Ninth Cavalrymen at the post that the old log barracks
buildings as well as the original laundresses&rsquo; quarters were
being used as dwellings for enlisted men&rsquo;s families. Some
new quarters for noncommissioned officers&rsquo; families were
also in use by this time, and the original 1874 officers&rsquo;
adobes eventually became noncom headquarters.</p>
<p>Construction and improvement continued in the early
1900&rsquo;s with the 1904 addition of a post gymnasium, and in
1905 a frame headquarters building was built. Today the
headquarters structure is the Fort Robinson Museum, a
branch of the Nebraska State Historical Society.</p>
<p>In 1901 a brick hospital building was erected, and the
old concrete structure became the Post Exchange. Before
the hospital was even completed the surgeon asked for an
additional wing, which was immediately added, as well as
a large annex at the rear to accommodate the increasing garrison.
Brick buildings built in 1906-1912 included stables,
stable guard quarters, blacksmith shops, fire station, bakery,
company barracks buildings, bachelor officers&rsquo; quarters
and officers&rsquo; residences. At one time an elaborate plan to
convert the entire post to the new brick style was drawn
up but was never carried out. Needless to say, along with
construction came the destruction of old and outmoded
buildings which were replaced. The only remnants of the
original post of the 1870&rsquo;s standing today are the six adobe
officers&rsquo; quarters.</p>
<p>In 1927 the Remount Service began new major construction,
building several elaborate horse stables. All buildings
were repaired and several recreational facilities were
built by the CCC during the 1930&rsquo;s. Expansion during World
War II included a large number of temporary buildings for
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
use by the War Dog Training Center and the Prisoner of
War Camp.</p>
<p>The temporary buildings were sold as surplus and removed
after the war, and more unused residences and other
buildings were torn down in 1956. There remains today an
example of each major building period at the post, although
some types of structures and materials used are no longer
to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="c11">FORT ROBINSON TODAY</h3>
<p>World War II marked the end of extensive use of horses
in military service. Fort Robinson was declared surplus by
the War Department and turned over to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. On April 29, 1949, the Bureau of Animal
Industry, U.S.D.A., in co-operation with the University of
Nebraska, established the Fort Robinson Beef Cattle Research
Station. Major research emphasis was on beef breeding
investigations before this service was phased out and
moved to Clay Center, Nebraska, toward the end of 1971.</p>
<p>The US. Department of Agriculture operated a Soil
Conservation Service Training Center at Fort Robinson from
October, 1954, until January 6, 1964. Men from the great
plains states and foreign countries were trained at the center
located in Comanche Hall, the former Bachelor Officers&rsquo;
Quarters.</p>
<p>Today Fort Robinson is operated under a cooperative
agreement between state agencies. The University of Nebraska
Department of Geology and State Museum have used
the post as a base for paleontological field parties, and the
Museum operates a branch, the Trailside Museum, at Fort
Robinson.</p>
<p>The Nebraska State Game and Parks Commission has
operated the Fort Robinson State Park facilities since 1956
with emphasis on recreation. The majority of the buildings
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
and most of the land is devoted to this purpose. Some of the
special buildings or areas are the lodge, restaurant, campgrounds,
and tourist cabins. Under construction by the commission
in 1978 is a swimming pool. A conference center and
golf course are projected by the commission for the future.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1967, Chadron State College converted the
1892 Quartermaster Stores Building into the Post Playhouse.
The college also produced pageants based on Fort
Robinson historical events.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Fort Robinson Branch Museum
of the Nebraska State Historical Society on June 3, 1956,
the Society has carried out a number of projects to preserve
and interpret the history of the historic post. Starting in
1958 the Society restored the Blacksmith and Harness Repair
shops. In 1966 archeological excavations began at the
site of the Guardhouse, Adjutant&rsquo;s Office and Cavalry Barracks,
all dating from 1874. The remains of the 1884 Guardhouse
were also uncovered.</p>
<p>These excavations provided information for the reconstruction
of the 1874 Guardhouse and Adjutant&rsquo;s Office.
The 1884 Wheelwright Shop, the oldest wooden structure on
the post, has also been restored. Restoration work has also
been carried out on the 1909 Veterinarian Hospital Building
and an 1887 Adobe Officers&rsquo; Quarters and the 1905 Post
Headquarters, which is utilized as a museum. The Post
Cemetery, the 1895 Granary, and the 1886 Bandleader&rsquo;s
Quarters are also in the process of restoration. Earlier the
Society had carried out limited archeological investigation
at the site of the Red Cloud Agency.</p>
<p>Today the staff of the Fort Robinson Museum provides
guided tours to historically significant areas of the post and,
as part of the interpretive program, presents evening programs
during the tourist season. The Society has also undertaken
a program of historic markers at Fort Robinson and
Red Cloud Agency, which have been designated a Registered
National Historic Landmark. Much of the restoration
work has been funded in part by grants from the National
Park Service.</p>

<p class="center"><b>VANCE E. NELSON</b>
<br />Curator, Fort Robinson Museum
<br />Nebraska State Historical Society
<br />Crawford, Nebraska</p>
<p>The Nebraska State Historical Society was founded as
the State Historical Society and Library Association in 1867,
the year Nebraska was admitted to the Union. It was reorganized
as the Nebraska State Historical Society in 1878.
It was constituted as a state organization by act of the Nebraska
Legislature in 1883, and designated custodian of all
public records, documents, and other materials of historical
value by legislative act of 1905. It moved into its present air-conditioned,
fireproof building in 1953.</p>
<p>The Society was created to collect and preserve the record
of Nebraska and its people. It maintains archives, a library,
and a museum for use of the public. It is particularly anxious
to secure valuable records and materials now in private hands
where they cannot be preserved.</p>
<p>In performing its important function, it solicits the support
of all public-spirited citizens&mdash;support which can best be expressed
through membership in the Society. Membership carries
with it a voice in the government of the Society, including
election of the members of the Executive Board. Members
receive, without further payment, NEBRASKA HISTORY, published
quarterly; and the HISTORICAL NEWS LETTER, issued
monthly. Applicants for membership should address Marvin
F. Kivett, Director, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1500 R
Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68508.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
